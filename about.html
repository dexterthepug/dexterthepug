          <p>Hello, my name is dexter the pug. I live on the Oregon coast, and
             like posing for the camera. watch me go on fun trips and see daily
             pics! My birthday is October 1st and I was adopted at thanksgiving.
             I live whith my human mom and my human sister, hilary and fiona. I
             also live with a silly cat named daisy that I like to chase around
             the house. I love to play with other pugs, and make friends easily.
             I am currently 10 months old, and like taking naps. Watch me grow
             up with my family and my dog friends!</p>
